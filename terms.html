                <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
                <p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> January 2025</p>
                
                <h2 style="margin-top: 2rem;">1. Agreement to Terms</h2>
                <p>By accessing or using Hevin Design's services, you agree to be bound by these Terms of Service. If you do not agree to these terms, please do not use our services.</p>
                
                <h2 style="margin-top: 2rem;">2. Services</h2>
                <p>Hevin Design provides web design, development, ecommerce, branding, hosting, and digital marketing services. Specific services, deliverables, timelines, and pricing will be outlined in individual project proposals.</p>
                
                <h2 style="margin-top: 2rem;">3. Project Scope & Changes</h2>
                <p>All projects begin with a written proposal detailing scope, deliverables, timeline, and costs. Changes to the agreed scope may result in additional fees and timeline adjustments. We will communicate all changes in writing before proceeding.</p>
                
                <h2 style="margin-top: 2rem;">4. Payment Terms</h2>
                <p>Setup fees are due according to the payment schedule outlined in your project proposal (typically 50% upfront, 50% upon completion). Monthly hosting and maintenance fees are billed in advance on a recurring basis. Late payments may result in service suspension.</p>
                
                <h2 style="margin-top: 2rem;">5. Client Responsibilities</h2>
                <p>Clients are responsible for providing timely feedback, content, images, and any required access or information. Delays in providing these materials may impact project timelines.</p>
                
                <h2 style="margin-top: 2rem;">6. Intellectual Property</h2>
                <p>Upon full payment, clients own all custom designs, content, and code created specifically for their project. Hevin Design retains the right to use project work in portfolios and marketing materials. Third-party components (themes, plugins, libraries) remain subject to their respective licenses.</p>
                
                <h2 style="margin-top: 2rem;">7. Warranties & Disclaimers</h2>
                <p>We warrant that services will be performed professionally and in accordance with industry standards. However, we do not guarantee specific results such as search rankings, traffic, or sales. Websites and services are provided "as is" after the warranty period (typically 30 days post-launch for bug fixes).</p>
                
                <h2 style="margin-top: 2rem;">8. Limitation of Liability</h2>
                <p>Hevin Design's total liability for any claims arising from services shall not exceed the amount paid for those services. We are not liable for indirect, incidental, or consequential damages.</p>
                
                <h2 style="margin-top: 2rem;">9. Termination</h2>
                <p>Either party may terminate services with written notice. Upon termination, clients are responsible for payment of work completed to date. Recurring services (hosting, maintenance) require 30 days written notice for cancellation.</p>
                
                <h2 style="margin-top: 2rem;">10. Confidentiality</h2>
                <p>We will keep all client information confidential and will not share it with third parties except as necessary to provide services or as required by law.</p>
                
                <h2 style="margin-top: 2rem;">11. Third-Party Services</h2>
                <p>Our services may integrate with third-party platforms (Shopify, Cloudflare, Stripe, etc.). Use of these platforms is subject to their respective terms and may incur separate fees.</p>
                
                <h2 style="margin-top: 2rem;">12. Dispute Resolution</h2>
                <p>Any disputes will be resolved through good faith negotiation. If unsuccessful, disputes will be subject to the laws of New South Wales, Australia.</p>
