# Logo File Note

The HTML has been updated to reference `logo.webp` instead of the PNG hosted on i.ibb.co.

**Action Required:**
Please add the WEBP logo file (glitched barcode-style "HEVIN DESIGN") as `logo.webp` to the root directory.

The image should be:
- Format: WEBP
- Dimensions: 120x120 pixels (or larger with proper aspect ratio)
- Style: Glitched barcode-style with "HEVIN DESIGN" text

If you have a PNG or other format, you can convert it to WEBP using:
- Online tools: https://cloudconvert.com/png-to-webp
- Command line: `cwebp input.png -o logo.webp`
